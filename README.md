# Python Learning and GitHub Usage Tutorials

## 1. Getting Started

**User:**  
PCan you help me learn Python? Start by asking me about my current level of programming knowledge.

---

## 2. Assessing Your Level

**Assistant:**  
Absolutely! To help you best, could you tell me about your current programming experience?  
- Are you completely new to programming?  
- Have you tried any other languages before (like Java, C, JavaScript, etc.)?  
- What is your goal with learning Python (e.g., data science, web development, automation, etc.)?

## 3. Step-by-Step Python Learning Suggestions

**User/Assistant:**  
(Here, you would continue the conversation about your programming level and goals. This section can include basic Python concepts: variables, data types, functions, control flow, etc.)

## 4. Adding Files to Your GitHub Repository via Web Interface

**User:**  
How do I add code to my GitHub repo?

**Assistant:**  

Here are the full steps to add a new file (or folder and files) to your GitHub repository using your phone and the GitHub web interface:

### 1. Go to Your Repository

- Visit: https://github.com/AbebawAll/First

### 2. Open the Code Tab

- You are already on the "Code" tab, as shown in your screenshot.

### 3. Add a New File

1. Tap the green **“Code”** button (with a plus sign), located above your file list.
2. From the dropdown, tap **“Create new file”**.

### 4. Name Your File (and Create Folders)

- In the top textbox labeled **“Name your file…”**, type the path for your file.  
  For example, to create the `server.py` file in a new `file_transfer` folder, type:

      file_transfer/server.py

- This will automatically create the `file_transfer` folder if it doesn’t exist.

### 5. Paste the File Content

- Scroll down to the large text area and **paste the code** you want for this file (you can copy the code from my earlier message).

### 6. Commit the New File

- Scroll further down, find the **“Commit new file”** section.
- In the **commit message** box, type something like:  
  `Add server.py for file transfer app`
- Tap the **“Commit new file”** button.

### 7. Repeat for All Files

Repeat steps 3–6 for each file you want to add:

- `file_transfer/wifi_direct.py`
- `file_transfer/file_manager.py`
- `file_transfer/requirements.txt`
- `file_transfer/README.md`
- `file_transfer/templates/index.html` (type the full path as shown)

### 8. Check Your Files

- After adding all files, the structure should look like this in your repository:
  ```
  First/
    file_transfer/
      server.py
      wifi_direct.py
      file_manager.py
      requirements.txt
      README.md
      templates/
        index.html
  ```

1. Tap the green **“Add file”** button.
2. Select **“Upload files”**.
3. Tap **“Choose your files”** and select the file from your phone.
4. Scroll down and tap **“Commit changes”**.
